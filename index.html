			<div class="grid_10 bio">

				<p class="bio">Ever since I was little I've tried to read patterns into everyday life, it wasn't until I was older that I realized I could do this for a living.</p>

				<p class="bio">In third grade I was banished to the hall with another student and a fourth grade math book, and ever since math came easy to me. From earning a Higher Level Certificate in Mathematics from the <a href="http://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib">International Baccalaureate</a> to completing a Master's in Mathematics, with a focus on Applied Abstract Algebra and courses in Statistical Theory, ANOVA and Design of Experiments and Applied Mathematics. Since July 2014 I have honed my skills in data science, working around deployment schedules to gain a Specialization in Data Science from Johns Hopkin's through Coursera. I have earned certificates in <a href="//www.coursera.org/accomplishments">Statistical Inference, Regression Models, Developing Data Products and more</a> completing each with distinction. I expect to complete this specialization January 2016.</p>

				<p class="bio">Since working on my Master's I have been a United States Navy Submarine Officer. This unique opportunity has taught me many important lessons, the most important of which being leadership. The ability to focus a watch team and direct them efficiently and effectively is not an ability that comes with rank or title, but must be earned. I was not evaluated as the number one Junior Officer onboard the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battenberg_Cup">best vessel in the Atlantic Fleet</a> for demanding respect, but for earning it. This is further exemplified in the two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals I received for my work as a watchstander and in coordinating a massive <a href=#>Material and Preservation Inspection</a>. Leading a team of unique individuals with highly varied skills is not only a skill I have cultivated, but an endeavour for which I have a great passion.</p>

				<p class="bio">I can bring many unique and varied skills to your company. I'm a quick learner with an aptitude for coding languages, currently utilizing R, Python, MySQL, HTML and CSS for <a href="http://www.github.com/chaserchap">various projects</a>. As a highly analytical thinker I can easily parse relevant information from a dataset, and have the coding and data wrangling skills to do so efficiently. I love a challenge and the opportunity to explore and expand my knowledge. Whether as part of a team or leading one, I am diligent in creating a work environment where myself and others can thrive. I look forward to the opportunity to show your company what I can accomplish for you.</p>
