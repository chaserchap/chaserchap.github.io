			<div class="grid_10 bio">

				<p class="bio">Ever since I was little I've tried to read patterns into everyday life, it wasn't until I was older that I realized I could do this for a living.</p>

				<p class="bio">In third grade I was banished to the hall with another student and a fourth grade math book, and ever since math came easy to me. From earning a Higher Level Certificate in Mathematics from the <a href="http://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib">International Baccalaureate</a> to completing a Master's in Mathematics, with a focus on Applied Abstract Algebra and courses in Statistical Theory, ANOVA and Design of Experiments and Applied Mathematics. At the time, I wasn't sure how to apply my newfound knowledge of math so I commisioned in the United States Navy as a Nuclear Submarine Officer. This choice, while not my passion, taught me many invaluable lessons. You will find no one with more fortitude and endurance than <a href="submariner.html">a Submariner.</a></p>

				<p class="bio">My heart lie somewhere else, however, and since July 2014 I have honed my skills in data science, working around deployment schedules to gain a Specialization in Data Science from Johns Hopkin's through Coursera. I have earned certificates in <a href="//www.coursera.org/accomplishments">Statistical Inference, Regression Models, Developing Data Products and more</a> completing each with distinction. I expect to complete this specialization January 2016.</p>

				<p class="bio">I can bring many unique and varied skills to your company. I'm a quick learner with an aptitude for coding languages, currently utilizing R, Python, MySQL, HTML and CSS for <a href="http://www.github.com/chaserchap">various projects</a>. As a highly analytical thinker I can easily parse relevant information from a dataset, and have the coding and data wrangling skills to do so efficiently. I continually look for ways to better both my understanding of machine learning concepts and coding skills.</p>
