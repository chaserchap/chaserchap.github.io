			<div class="grid_10 bio">
				<p class="bio"> You may be asking yourself, how does a prior US Navy Submarine Officer fit in at our company? Let me explain...</p>
				<p><strong>Adaptability.</strong><br>Everyday submariners face new and unique challenges, their ability to overcome these challenges, while limited by resources and time, can be the only thing that stands between them and the salty brine. This has translated into the ability to learn new skills at a fast pace and to utilize the resources at hand to accomplish projects. When it comes to training, one is expected to learn to "drink from a firehose." There is little time for the unknowledgeable and untrained, so we learn to adapt and learn quickly.</p>
				<p><strong>Independence.</strong><br>Often I was asked to complete some task, most often with little background or direction. This created within me an ability to take these projects and complete them, learning what was necessary, determining my own requirements, and polishing a finished project that in one instance led to the highest score on a material inspection on any Ohio Class submarine in the last 6 years.</p>
				<p><strong>Management.</strong><br>A submarine is made up of 14 divisions with over 150 personnel. This develops not only people skills and communications, but an ability to organize work centers, deconflict maintenance and operations, and determine which projects warrant more attention, and which must be abandoned due to situational  requirements. </p>
				<p><strong>Work Ethic.</strong><br>While a submarine works on the same 24 hour schedule as the rest of the world, our work days do not follow a traditional 9 to 5. After 8 hours of watch one can look forward to training, meetings, divisional and collateral duties as well as anything else that may come up. Sleep and personal time have a tendency to get overlooked in lieu of completing the mission. Rest assured that I will work assiduously to accomplish the project at hand.</p>
				<p>These are but a few of the attributes you can expect from a submariner. While certainly not an exhaustive list, it shows what a great asset to your company a submariner can be.</p>
