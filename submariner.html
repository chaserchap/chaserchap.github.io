				<p class="bio"> You may be asking yourself, how does a prior US Navy Submarine Officer fit in at our company? Let me explain...</p>
				<p class="bio"><strong>Adaptability.</strong><br>Everyday submariners face new and unique challenges, their ability to overcome these challenges, while limited by resources and time, can be the only thing that stands between them and the salty brine. This has translated into the ability to learn new skills at a fast pace and to utilize the resources at hand to accomplish projects. This ability is a primary reason I was evaluated as the #1 Junior Officer on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battenberg_Cup">best vessel in the Atlantic Fleet</a>.</p>
				<p class="bio"><strong>Independence.</strong><br>Often I was asked to complete some task, most often with little background or direction. This created within me an ability to take these projects and complete them, learning what was necessary, determining my own requirements, and polishing a finished project that in one instance led to the highest score on a material inspection on any Ohio Class submarine in the last 6 years.</p>
				<p class="bio"><strong>Management.</strong><br>A submarine is made up of 14 divisions with over 150 personnel. This develops not only people skills and communications, but an ability to organize work centers, to deconflict maintenance and operations, and to determine which projects warrant more attention, and which must be abandoned due to situation requirements. </p>
